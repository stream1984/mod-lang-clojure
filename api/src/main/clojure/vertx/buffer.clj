  "Functions for operating on Vert.x Buffers.
   A Buffer represents a sequence of zero or more bytes that can be
   written to or read from, and which expands as necessary to
   accommodate any bytes written to it.

   append!, set! and as-buffer take several different types of data
   that can be written to a buffer these types are referred to
   collectively as \"bufferable\", and are:

   * Buffer
   * Byte
   * byte[]
   * Double
   * BigDecimal (coerced to a Double)
   * Ratio (coerced to a Double)
   * Float
   * Integer
   * Long
   * BigInt (coerced to a Long)
   * Short
   * String"
